BreastCancer_Classifier_Comparison

This project was undertaken as part of my efforts to explore and compare the performance of multiple machine learning models using the Wisconsin Dataset for Breast Cancer Classification. I also wrote a paper as part of this analysis, which is available upon request for any prospective employer.

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and can be found at the following link: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites

Python 3.7 or later
Jupyer Notebook
Required Python packages:
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Ensure these packages are installed in your environment before proceeding.

Installing

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to setting up the project:

Clone the repository

Open your terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/af3285/Wisconsin_portfolio-.git
cd Wisconsin_portfolio-
jupyter notebook Projectworkbook.ipynb
Then follow the instructions provided in the command line

Alternativly, this code can also be directly copy and pasted into a .ipynb file in any IDE of your choice 

Once the notebook is executed, it will:

Load the Wisconsin Dataset for Breast Cancer Classification.
Perform preprocessing and data splitting into training and testing sets.
Train multiple machine learning models, including logistic regression, support vector machines, Naive Bayes.
Compare the models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Generate visualizations for performance evaluation.
