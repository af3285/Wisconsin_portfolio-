# Wisconsin_portfolio-
This is a project with the goal of creating and comparing the performance of multiple machine learning models using the Wisconsin Dataset for Breast Cancer Classification. I also wrote a paper as part of this analysis which is available upon the request of any would be employer. This dataset is sourced from the UCI and can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic. This code should be able to run as it is written without any modifications assuming our python installation are not radically different, this is the code I wrote for one of my recent research projects, my next project will be one I will be generating from scratch and it will most likely be a package of genomic algortihms and useful functions for Python. I do not currently have an ETA on when this next project when it will be done but I am planning on starting work on it around 12/16/24.
