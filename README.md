This is a project with the goal of creating and comparing the performance of multiple machine learning models using the Wisconsin Dataset for Breast Cancer Classification. I also wrote a paper as part of this analysis which is available upon the request of any would be employer. This dataset is sourced from the UCI and can be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/17/breast+cancer+wisconsin+diagnostic
